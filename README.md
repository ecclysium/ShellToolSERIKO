# Shell Tool for SERIKO

This program is for quickly assembling shell code and being able to see a rough sketch of how it will work out beforehand. It only shows images as overlay, so differences in how images combine may not be seen; however, starting and stopping other animations does work. 
Hopefully this makes the task less daunting, or helps out with mass importing dressups. Having another frame or animation selected while importing another makes it use the same settings by default.

A known bug is how list items do not update font size immediately, and won't fit the rest of the screen until interacted with. 

It's understood that the .exe file might not always run properly, so if its giving an error, make sure you have Java JDK 17 or later installed from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/ , and if it still is giving an error, try using the .jar instead. 

Feel free to message me as 'ecclysium' on Discord if you have any questions, suggestions, or bugs!
